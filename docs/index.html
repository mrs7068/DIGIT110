        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <h2>I hate that.</h2>
        <h3>I really hate that.</h3>
        <p>As a former Computer Science major, I've seen "Hello world!" more times than I'd like to
            remember. Here is my attempt at witty sample content to show I thought about this for
            more than 1 millisecond. I like all of those fruits so I'm going to keep the following
            list after this image of a jellyfish:</p>
        <img src="images/jellyfish.jpg" alt="image of a jellyfish" />
        <!--ebb: When pointing to images in your own repo, always use *relative* file associations: Here we are pointing to an images directory that's in the same
        folder as this HTML file we're editing. And we're going into the images folder to deliver the newt-mosaic4.png file inside. -->
        <ul>
            <li>apples</li>
            <li>oranges</li>
            <li>bananas</li>

        <!--ebb: The <a> element above is showing how to make an *absolute* file association with a literal, full website address. 
            Only do this for pointing OUTSIDE your own repo. -->
