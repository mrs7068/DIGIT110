    <!--Tasks: Write XSLT template rules to do the following:-->
        
     <!--1. Change the <poemTitle> elements to <title>.-->
        <xsl:template match="poemTitle">
            <title>
                <xsl:apply-templates/>
            </title>
        </xsl:template>     
     <!--2. We don't need the <body> elements, so let's remove them but preserve their contents-->
        <xsl:template match="body">
            <xsl:apply-templates/>
        </xsl:template>
     
     <!--The next questions ask you to write Attribute Value templates to pull in a value, or calculate a value from the source XML.
    READ ABOUT/LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF ATTRIBUTE VALUE TEMPLATES HERE:

   <!-- 3. Write a template that matches the <pb> elements: Write an AVT to change the name of the @pNum to @n on those elements.-->
         <xsl:template match="pb">
             <pb n="{@pNum}"/>
             <xsl:apply-templates/>
         </xsl:template>
     
    <!--4. Change the <line> elements into self-closing <lb/> elements to sit at the beginning of each line. 
    Can you also put an @n attribute on each line to number the lines inside the poem? 
    (You can calculate this with XPath by counting the **preceding** line elements in the document and adding 1. 
    Hint: Take a look at the difference if you count(preceding::line) as opposed to count(preceding-sibling::line). How does the
    count change?)-->
        <xsl:template match="line">
            <lb n="{count(preceding::line) + 1}"/>    <!--"preceding" counts the total number of lines (lb elements) in the entire document; "preceding-sibling" counts the lines beginning within each stanza, which I think is slightly more helpful (most helpful would be to count within each poem element)-->
            <xsl:apply-templates/>
        </xsl:template>

    <!--5. Each poem should have a distinct identifier, usually called an @xml:id attribute.
    Write an attribute value template to add an xml:id attribute to each poem that includes "p-" followed by its number in the sequence of poem elements. 
    (As before, you can calculate this with XPath by counting the preceding poem elements and adding 1.)-->
        <xsl:template match="poem">
            <poem xml:id="p-{count(preceding-sibling::poem) + 1}">
                <xsl:apply-templates/>
            </poem>
