        CHORUS
        This is my battle song
        I get down on my knees
        When everything's just going wrong
        You're all I need
        This is my battle cry 
        I'm a child of God
        (ooh’s) I praise and lift my hands up high
        Cause you are enough
        
        VERSE 1
        When I'm backed up
        In a corner
        Getting warmer
        And the battle starts to rage
        Oh I might seem
        Surrounded 
        But I'm grounded 
        In the power of your name
        
        CHORUS
        This is my battle song
        I get down on my knees
        (ooh’s) When everything's just going wrong
        You're all I need
        This is my battle cry 
        I'm a child of God
        (ooh’s) I praise and lift my hands up high
        Cause you are enough
        
        BRIDGE (x2) (Ephesians 6:10-18)
        The belt of truth
        The sword of the spirit 
        This is my Foundation
        The shield of faith
        The darkness fears it
        The helmet of salvation 
        The breastplate of righteousness 
        My defenses are in place 
        No weapon formed against me shall
        Prosper now I'm not afraid
        
        VERSE 1
        When I'm backed up
        In a corner
        Getting warmer
        And the battle starts to rage
        Oh I might seem surrounded 
        But I'm grounded 
        In the power of your name
        
        TAG
        You are all I need (yeah…)
        You are the strength in me
        
        CHORUS
        This is my battle song
        I get down on my knees
        (ooh’s) When everything's just going wrong
        You're all I need
        This is my battle cry 
        I'm a child of God
        (ooh’s) I praise and lift my hands up high
        Cause you are enough
        
        (KEY CHANGE TO E)
        
        CHORUS 
        This is my battle song
        I get down on my knees
        (ooh’s) When everything's just going wrong
        You're all I need
        This is my battle cry 
        I'm a child of God
        (ooh’s) I praise and lift my hands up high
        Cause you are enough
